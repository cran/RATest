\usage{
CvM.stat(Sn)
}
\arguments{
\item{Sn}{Numeric. The pooled sample of induced order statistics. The first column of S can be viewed as an independent sample of W conditional on Z being close to zero from the left. Similarly, the second column of S can be viewed as an independent sample of W conditional on Z being close to the cutoff from the right. See section 3 in Canay and Kamat (2017).}
}
\value{
Returns the numeric value of the Cramer - von Mises test statistic.
}
\description{
Calculates the Cramer-von Mises test statistic \deqn{T(S_n)=\frac{1}{2q}\sum_{i=1}^{2q}\left(H^-_n(S_{n,i})-H^+_n(S_{n,i})\right)^2} where \eqn{H^-_n(\cdot)} and \eqn{H^+_n(\cdot)} are the empirical CDFs of the the sample of baseline covariates close to the cutoff from the left and right, respectively. See equation (12) in Canay and Kamat (2017).
