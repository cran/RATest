# RATest R package

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/RATest)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RATest)

It implements a collection of randomization tests. It facilitates the empirical researcher to test for particular hypotheses, such as comparisons of means, medians, and variances from k populations using robust permutation tests, which asymptotic validity holds under very weak assumptions, while retaining the exact rejection probability in finite samples when the underlying distributions are identical.

In addition, this R package implements the permutation test proposed by Canay and Kamat (2017) for testing the null hypothesis of continuity of the distribution of the baseline covariates at the cutoff for Sharp RDD.
